## 0.11.0 (2026-09-14)

### Breaking Changes

- Remove contextual fields from several error variants to reduce `Error` enum size.

#### Let a reconnecting user register a new app key

When `reconnecting()` is true, `register` / `connect_pre_authorized` no longer fail just because the recovery phrase derives a different app key; a new application key will be registered instead.

To let applications detect whether a recovery phrase matches an already-registered app key, this adds `matches_existing_app_key` (JS: `matchesExistingAppKey`).

This removes the `BuilderError::WrongRecoveryPhrase` variant.

#### Renamed the share URL methods on `Sdk`.

`Sdk::share_object` and `Sdk::shared_object` are now `Sdk::object_share_url` and `Sdk::object_from_share_url`. The bindings change to match, so `shareObject` and `sharedObject` become `objectShareUrl` and `objectFromShareUrl`.

### Features

- Added sharing keys support to the ffi and napi bindings.
- Added `Download::write_to_path` for writing a download directly to a file.

#### Added `connect_pre_authorized` for connecting with a pre-authorized key.

Applications can now bypass the interactive approval flow by connecting with a pre-authorized key that the indexer operator provisions out of band. `Builder::connect_pre_authorized(pre_authorized_key, mnemonic)` performs the connect, approval, and registration steps in one call and returns a ready SDK. The method is also exposed through the ffi, napi, and wasm bindings.

#### Added `reconnecting` to the connection approval flow.

After approval, `reconnecting()` reports whether the connect key already has an account for the application. When reconnecting, `register` and `connect_pre_authorized` fail with `WrongRecoveryPhrase` if the recovery phrase does not match the existing account.

### Fixes

- Added the HTTP status code to `AppApiError::Api` and removed the `Unauthorized` and `NotFound` variants
- Increased default API timeout for slow indexers.
- Retry failed shards up to three times before failing the download.
- Added a method for truncating objects.

#### Fixed a crash when a logger is set again from a rebuilt foreign runtime.

Setting a logger replaces the stored handle, and releasing the old one calls back into the runtime that created it. A host that tears its runtime down and sets a logger again from the new one, as a React Native dev server reload does, left that release reading freed memory and taking the process down. The previous handle is now kept instead.

## 0.10.0 (2026-08-07)

### Breaking Changes

- Add a version field to slabs.
- Added `PackedUploadoptions` for packed uploads.

### Features

- Encrypt object data per slab so each slab can be re-encrypted independently without reusing the object's data key.
- Switch sector root and range proof verifier to optimized SIMD backends.

#### Added path-based uploads behind the `fs` feature.

`Sdk::upload_path` and `PackedUpload::add_path` open a file and read it to EOF, so callers uploading from disk no longer stream every chunk across the language boundary. The feature is unavailable on wasm32; the FFI and Node bindings enable it and expose `uploadPath`/`addPath`.

#### Added `start_offset` to `UploadOptions`.

This allows objects to be rewritten without reuploading the entire object. The original object is not replaced, so both versions can be pinned simultaneously.

#### Uploads will no longer block indefinitely until completion.

Removed the progressive upload timeout and hosts are now retried a maximum of 3 times before giving up. The default 
timeout is now 1.5m per shard per attempt. This should give enough time on slow connections. Racing and prioritization
will still prioritize faster hosts after warming up.

Users can still manually timeout

### Fixes

#### Reject malformed share-link encryption keys.

The error for a bad share-link key now states it must be base64url-encoded rather than hex (the fragment was already decoded as base64url), and a fragment that does not decode to exactly 32 bytes is rejected instead of being silently zero-padded into a bogus key.

## 0.9.0 (2026-06-23)

### Breaking Changes

- Changed DownloadOptions::max_inflight from u8 to u32.

#### Added adaptive transfer concurrency

Uploads and downloads no longer take a fixed `max_inflight` concurrency limit — concurrency now adapts to network conditions automatically. Memory use is bounded directly instead, by two new options: `UploadOptions::max_buffered_slabs` and `DownloadOptions::max_buffered_chunks`, each defaulting to roughly 10% of system memory when unset. The `max_inflight` field is removed from the upload, download, and language-binding option types.

### Features

- Changed download chunking to ramp up to reduce round trips on large downloads.
- Overprovision shard downloads to reduce tail latency from slow hosts

### Fixes

- Removed rayon dependency due to panics at high concurrency

#### Made racing adaptive so that racers will not steal slots from higher priority work

For uploads, racing will only start when every shard has an attempt in flight. For downloads, racing will only start when the chunk is near the read head. The race timeout is derived from the p95 of recently completed RPCs instead of a fixed interval so only hosts well outside the normal latency spread get raced.

## 0.8.1 (2026-05-18)

### Fixes

- Bump sia_core_derive.

## 0.8.0 (2026-04-27)

### Breaking Changes

#### Rename `AppMeta` to `AppMetadata`

The uniffi struct accepted by `Builder::new` is now named `AppMetadata`, matching the Rust SDK and the WASM binding.

#### Rename `slab_size` to `optimal_data_size` where it refers to the data-only portion

Methods and fields that previously returned or stored `data_shards * SECTOR_SIZE` (the packing period for `PackedUpload`) are now named `optimal_data_size` to distinguish them from the true encoded slab size (`total_shards * SECTOR_SIZE`, which remains `slab_size`). Affects `PackedUpload::slab_size()` (Rust, FFI, NAPI) and the `slabSize` JS getter (now `optimalDataSize`).

`UploadOptions::slab_size()`, `UploadOptions::optimal_data_size()`, `PackedUpload::optimal_data_size()`, and `PackedUpload::slabs()` now return `usize` instead of `u64`.

#### Simplify `PackedUpload` binding internals

Replaced the per-upload mpsc actor with a mutex and a cancellation token. Errors from `add` and `finalize` now propagate directly instead of through a oneshot that could swallow them, and no background task is kept per upload.

`cancel` is now sync (`fn cancel(&self)`) on the FFI and NAPI bindings, dropping the `async` and `Result` return — flipping a token and aborting in-flight tasks is fast and cannot fail. WASM was already sync.

### Features

- `upload_packed` now returns a `Result` and will error if invalid options are passed to it.

#### `PackedUpload` stays usable after a reader error

If the reader passed to `add` errored mid-stream, bytes it had already buffered were silently attributed to the next object, corrupting it. Partial reads now become dead padding in the slab and subsequent objects stay aligned.

### Fixes

- Rename download close function

## 0.7.0 (2026-04-18)

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced upload/download progress channels with more detailed callbacks.

#### Download returns an AsyncRead

`SDK::download` now returns a `Download` handle implementing `AsyncRead`
instead of taking a writer. Callers pull data with `tokio::io::copy` or any
other `AsyncRead` consumer.

The `sia_storage_ffi` `SDK::download` now returns a `Download` object with
`read()` and `close()` methods instead of taking a foreign `Writer`. The
`Writer` foreign trait has been removed.

### Fixes

- Removed hardcoded 1s timeout for RPC settings when writing and reading sectors

## 0.6.1 (2026-04-06)

### Features

- Remove redundant FFI chunked download loop and delegate to the SDK directly.

## 0.6.0 (2026-04-06)

### Breaking Changes

#### Resumable uploads

`SDK::upload` now takes an `Object` parameter and appends uploaded slabs to it. This enables resumable uploads by passing the same object back to `upload` with a new reader.

For new uploads, pass `Object::default()` (Rust) or `PinnedObject::new()` (FFI). This is a breaking change to the upload API signature.

## 0.5.1 (2026-04-05)

### Features

- Download objects in chunks to improve streaming.

#### Replace PrivateKey with AppKey in public API

Replaced all uses of `PrivateKey` in the public API with `AppKey`. `PrivateKey` is no longer re-exported.

Added `UploadOptions::validate` to check erasure coding parameters for sufficient durability.

Made internal `app_client::Client` methods `pub(crate)` and moved data types (`App`, `Account`, `GeoLocation`, `HostQuery`, `ObjectsCursor`) to `lib.rs`.

Added doc strings to all public items.

### Fixes

- Simplified FFI reader and writer by polling the future instead of passing through channels and a background task.
- Update account types

## 0.5.0 (2026-03-23)

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed crate to `sia_storage_ffi`

## 0.4.0 (2026-03-18)

### Features

- Introduce mux crate and frame module
- Return `sia://` links from the indexd SDK.

### Fixes

- use AsyncRead/AsyncWrite traits instead of Ext variants in trait bounds
- Added cancel function to cancel inflight packed uploads.
- Fix slab length in packed object
- Improved parallelism of packed uploads.
- Progress callback will now be called as expected for packed uploads.

#### Check if we have enough hosts prior to encoding in upload_slabs

##261 by @Alrighttt

Fixes https://github.com/SiaFoundation/sia-sdk-rs/issues/251

- Added an `available_for_upload` method that returns the amount of known hosts marked `good_for_upload`.
- Added a check in `upload_slabs` that verifies we have enough good hosts prior to encoding any data. 
- Adds a variant to `QueueError` for `upload_slabs`'s new failure case. This enables testing for this new case specifically.

#### Go SDK test parity

##266 by @Alrighttt

This pull requests adds some missing test cases that exist within the Go SDK. Closes https://github.com/SiaFoundation/sia-sdk-rs/issues/220

The remaining tests that have not been ported require changes to the `SDK` struct to allow mocking the `api_client`. I will work on a solution for this.

## 0.3.0 (2026-01-28)
