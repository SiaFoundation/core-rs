## 0.5.0 (2026-09-14)

### Breaking Changes

- Remove contextual fields from several error variants to reduce `Error` enum size.
- Removed the `blake2` module and the `blake2`/`hkdf` dependencies.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue with RPCRead where the returned bytes could be longer than the requested length.
- Reupload slabs whose sectors expired from temporary storage
- use --locked for cargo install wasm-pack

## 0.4.2 (2026-08-07)

### Features

- Switch sector root and range proof verifier to optimized SIMD backends.

## 0.4.1 (2026-05-18)

### Fixes

- Bump sia_core_derive.

## 0.4.0 (2026-05-18)

### Breaking Changes

#### Use u64 for output and contract ID derive indices

Changed the index parameter on `TransactionID`, `BlockID`, and `FileContractID`
ID-derive methods from `usize` to `u64`: `siacoin_output_id`, `siafund_output_id`,
`file_contract_id`, `miner_output_id`, `v2_siacoin_output_id`, `v2_siafund_output_id`,
`v2_file_contract_id`, `v2_attestation_id`, `valid_output_id`, and `missed_output_id`.

The hash input was already serialized as a little-endian `u64`, so on-chain IDs
are unchanged. The previous signature silently truncated indices to 32 bits on
`wasm32` (where `usize == u32`).

### Fixes

- Remove rayon crate from dependencies on WASM.

## 0.3.1 (2026-04-05)

### Fixes

## 0.2.2 (2026-03-18)

### Features

- Implements the Siamux multiplexer

## 0.2.1 (2026-03-16)

### Features

- Introduce mux crate and frame module
- use ring instead of chacha20poly1305; optimize frame module to reduce copies

### Fixes

- use AsyncRead/AsyncWrite traits instead of Ext variants in trait bounds
- Fixes a bug where object decryption silently fails

#### Check if we have enough hosts prior to encoding in upload_slabs

##261 by @Alrighttt

Fixes https://github.com/SiaFoundation/sia-sdk-rs/issues/251

- Added an `available_for_upload` method that returns the amount of known hosts marked `good_for_upload`.
- Added a check in `upload_slabs` that verifies we have enough good hosts prior to encoding any data. 
- Adds a variant to `QueueError` for `upload_slabs`'s new failure case. This enables testing for this new case specifically.

#### Go SDK test parity

##266 by @Alrighttt

This pull requests adds some missing test cases that exist within the Go SDK. Closes https://github.com/SiaFoundation/sia-sdk-rs/issues/220

The remaining tests that have not been ported require changes to the `SDK` struct to allow mocking the `api_client`. I will work on a solution for this.

## 0.2.0 (2026-01-28)

### Fixes

- Fix element accumulator encoding
