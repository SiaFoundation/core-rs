# Update sia-storage-js for a new Rust SDK release

`SiaFoundation/sia-storage-js` is the TypeScript wrapper around this repository's
`sia_storage_napi` and `sia_storage_wasm` crates. A release here means that wrapper
needs to move forward. Your job is to move it forward and open one pull request.

## What is already set up

- `sia-storage-js/` is a checkout of `SiaFoundation/sia-storage-js` (branch `main`).
  **Every command and every edit below happens inside that directory** — the workspace
  root is a checkout of this repository and is not what you are changing.
- `sia-storage-js/rust/sia-sdk-rs/` is a checkout of this repository at the anchor
  commit — the commit the triggering release tagged, and the same path
  `scripts/setup-rust.ts` clones into. It is gitignored, so nothing under it can reach
  the pull request.
- Bun, Node 24, a stable Rust toolchain with `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, and `wasm-pack`
  are installed.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/sdk-update.json` — current pins, target pins, the anchor tag and commit,
  whether both crates were tagged on that commit, and whether the pin is already current.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/bindings.diff` — the diff of `sia_storage_napi/src` and `sia_storage_wasm/src`
  between the current and target tags. This is the primary signal for what changed.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/changelog.md` — changelog heads for the released crates.

If `both_tagged` is false, only one of the two crates was released on the anchor commit,
so the other keeps its existing pin. That breaks the assumption `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
and `scripts/setup-rust.ts` are built on — one clone at the napi tag serving both crates —
because the two pins now name different commits. Do not paper over it: finish the update
if you can, and state the divergence prominently at the top of the pull request body.

## Task

1. **Update the pin.** Set `napi` and `wasm` in `.sia-sdk-rs.json` to the target tags.
   If `pin_already_current` is true the daily `check-sdk-update.yml` job already landed
   the bump — leave the file and the existing changeset alone and continue to step 2,
   since the wrapper work may still be outstanding.

2. **Build.** Run, in order:

   ```
   bun install
   bun run setup-napi-test
   bun run build
   bun run typecheck
   bun test src/tests/install-integration.test.ts
   ```

   `setup-napi-test` builds the NAPI binary for this runner (`linux-x64-gnu`), stages it
   into `node_modules`, and regenerates the gitignored `src/node/napi.generated.d.ts`.
   `bun run build` builds WASM, bundles with tsup, and emits the Node type entrypoint.

3. **Fix what broke.** Repair failures in `src/` and `scripts/` caused by the SDK bump —
   renamed or removed exports, changed signatures, changed generated type names. Fix the
   cause, not the symptom: if a type name changed upstream, follow the rename through
   rather than casting it away. Never silence an error with `any` or `@ts-ignore`.

4. **Wrap new types and methods.** The wrapper re-exports the bindings by hand through
   two surfaces. Both are hand-maintained lists — extend them, do not restructure them:

   - `src/index.ts` (browser/WASM): add new classes and functions to the
     `export { … } from '../wasm/sia_storage_wasm.js'` block and new types to the
     `export type { … }` block. Both are alphabetized, classes before functions.
   - `src/node/napi.ts` (Node/NAPI): add new classes and functions to the
     `export const { … } = addon` destructuring. Types need no change — they flow from
     `export type * from './napi.generated'`. This list groups classes first, then
     functions, and is not alphabetized; append within the matching group.

   Only export bindings the crates actually expose at the target tag. Confirm each one
   against `rust/sia-sdk-rs/sia_storage_wasm/src` or the regenerated
   `src/node/napi.generated.d.ts` before adding it — do not infer an export from the
   changelog alone. Keep the two surfaces consistent: a binding exposed by both crates
   should appear in both files.

   Do not invent new abstractions, helper wrappers, re-shaped APIs, or new files. If a
   new binding genuinely cannot be expressed in the existing structure, leave it out and
   say so in the pull request body.

5. **Re-run the full sequence from step 2** until `typecheck` and the install integration
   test pass. If you cannot get them green, still open the pull request, but say plainly
   at the top of the body what is failing and paste the error.

6. **Write the changeset.** Create `.changeset/sdk-update.md` (skip if step 1 found the
   pin already current and the changeset already exists), matching the format
   `check-sdk-update.yml` uses so the two paths do not produce conflicting entries:

   ```
   ---
   default: patch
   ---

   #### Update sia-sdk-rs (napi v0.0.0, wasm v0.0.0)
   ```

   Use `minor` instead of `patch` when the update adds new exports to the wrapper's public
   surface. Strip the `sia_storage_napi/` and `sia_storage_wasm/` prefixes from the tags in
   the heading. If the entry needs more than the heading, follow it with prose — not a list.

7. **Update the README.** Its `## API` section documents the public API. Bring it in
   line with the target tag:

   - rename or remove anything renamed or removed upstream, in the API section and in
     the code examples
   - add everything you exported in step 4 in the existing format, with a new `###`
     section for each new class
   - add to `## Node vs browser` any new method whose WASM and NAPI types differ

   Check signatures against `wasm/sia_storage_wasm.d.ts` and
   `src/node/napi.generated.d.ts`, not the changelog. Change nothing else in the README.

## Output

Emit one `create_pull_request` targeting `SiaFoundation/sia-storage-js`. Title it
`update sia-sdk-rs (napi vX.Y.Z, wasm vX.Y.Z)` (the `chore: ` prefix is added for you).
The body should cover, in prose:

- the version move, and the upstream changes that motivated it
- every export added to `src/index.ts` and `src/node/napi.ts`, and what each one is for
- every build or type break you fixed, and how
- the README entries you added, renamed, or removed
- anything left undone: a binding you could not wrap, a failing check, or a tag divergence

Call `noop` with a short explanation instead of opening a pull request when the pin is
already current, the build and typecheck pass untouched, the release exposes no new
bindings, and the README already matches the API — that is the expected outcome for a
release that only changes crate internals.
