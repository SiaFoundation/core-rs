# Update sia-storage-sdk for a new sia_storage_ffi release

`SiaFoundation/sia-storage-sdk` exposes this repository's `sia_storage_ffi` crate to
Python, Swift, and Kotlin through UniFFI. Each language has generated bindings plus a
hand-written wrapper layer on top. The repin and version mirroring are already done for
you; your job is everything a `sed` cannot do — regenerate the bindings, make all three
languages build again, and extend the wrappers to cover what the release added.

## What is already set up

- `sia-storage-sdk/` is a checkout of `SiaFoundation/sia-storage-sdk` (branch `master`).
  **Every command and every edit below happens inside that directory.**
- The repin is already applied and verified there: `Cargo.toml` (`rev` + `version`),
  `Cargo.lock`, `Package.swift`, `SiaStorageSDK.podspec`, `kotlin/gradle.properties`,
  `examples/kotlin/gradle.properties`, `kotlin/README.md`, `examples/kotlin/README.md`,
  and `swift/README.md`. Do not redo this by hand. Do not touch the `checksum:` in
  `Package.swift` — the Swift release job sets it when it publishes the xcframework.
- Rust, Python 3.12, JDK 17, Gradle 8.10.2, and maturin are installed.
- The workspace root holds a checkout of this repository, but its `Cargo.toml` has
  been moved aside so cargo treats `sia-storage-sdk/` as the standalone package it
  is. Do not restore it, and do not build anything from the root checkout.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/sdk-update.json` — old and new rev/version, the release tag, whether the
  repin actually happened, and why not if it did not.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/ffi.diff` — the diff of `sia_storage_ffi/src` between the old and new revs.
  This is the primary signal for what changed in the FFI surface.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/changelog.md` — changelog heads for `sia_core`, `sia_storage`, `sia_storage_ffi`.
- `/tmp/gh-aw/sia-sdk-rs/` — a full checkout of this repository, for reading the crate
  source directly when the diff is not enough.

If `repinned` is false, read `skip_reason`. Either the pin is already current or the
release would be a downgrade. Nothing was modified; call `noop` and stop.

## Task

1. **Build and regenerate the bindings.** From the repository root:

   ```
   cargo build --release
   cargo run --release --bin uniffi-bindgen -- generate \
     --library target/release/libsia_storage_ffi.so \
     --language swift --out-dir build/generated --config swift/uniffi.toml
   cp build/generated/SiaStorageSDK.swift swift/Sources/SiaStorageSDK/SiaStorageSDK.swift
   cargo run --release --bin uniffi-bindgen -- generate \
     --library target/release/libsia_storage_ffi.so \
     --language kotlin --out-dir kotlin/src/main/kotlin --config kotlin/uniffi.toml --no-format
   ```

   `swift/Sources/SiaStorageSDK/SiaStorageSDK.swift` is generated but committed, so it
   must be regenerated and will show up in the diff. The Kotlin and Python generated
   modules are gitignored — they exist only to build and test against.

2. **Verify Kotlin.**

   ```
   mkdir -p kotlin/src/main/resources/linux-x86-64
   cp target/release/libsia_storage_ffi.so kotlin/src/main/resources/linux-x86-64/
   cd kotlin && gradle test
   ```

3. **Verify Python.** Build and install the wheel into a virtualenv, then import it.
   Skip `--release`; this is an import check, not a benchmark.

   ```
   mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/agent
   python -m venv /tmp/gh-aw/agent/venv
   VENV=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/venv
   $VENV/bin/pip install -q maturin
   cd python && $VENV/bin/maturin build --out dist
   $VENV/bin/pip install --force-reinstall dist/*.whl
   $VENV/bin/python -c "import sia_storage; from sia_storage import SDK, Builder, generate_recovery_phrase; print(len(sia_storage.__all__), 'exports')"
   ```

   The import is the real test: `python/sia_storage/__init__.py` re-exports every name
   explicitly, so a renamed or removed FFI type fails at import time.

4. **Fix what broke and extend the wrappers.** Each language has a different rule.
   Extend the existing structure; do not restructure it, and do not add new files.

   - **Python — `python/sia_storage/__init__.py` (required for every new type).** Names
     are invisible to users until listed here. Add each new binding to *both* the
     `from sia_storage.sia_storage.sia_storage_ffi import (...)` block and `__all__`,
     under the matching `# Functions` / `# Classes/Objects` / `# Records` / `# Enums` /
     `# Errors` / `# Base classes ...` comment group. Preserve the existing aliases
     (`SDK = Sdk`, `IOError = IoError`) and the alias comments in `__all__`.
   - **Python — `python/sia_storage/wrappers.py`.** Idiomatic layer over the raw
     bindings. Its top-level import block must stay in sync with what it uses. Extend
     only when a new binding needs the same treatment the existing ones get.
   - **Swift — `swift/Sources/SiaStorageSDK/Wrappers.swift`.** Extensions and
     conveniences only; the generated file already exposes the raw API. Follow the
     existing conventions: `/** ... */` doc comments with a runnable `Example:` block,
     `extension` on the generated type rather than a new wrapper type.
   - **Kotlin — `kotlin/src/main/kotlin/sia/indexd/Wrappers.kt`.** Same shape as Swift:
     KDoc with an `Example:` block, extension functions on the generated types.
   - **Examples.** `examples/python/example.py`, `examples/swift/Sources/main.swift`, and
     `examples/kotlin/src/main/kotlin/Example.kt` must keep compiling against the new
     API. The Swift CI builds `examples/swift`, so a break there fails the pull request.

   Only wrap bindings the crate actually exposes at the new rev. Confirm each against
   `/tmp/gh-aw/sia-sdk-rs/sia_storage_ffi/src` or the regenerated Swift file before
   adding it — do not infer an export from the changelog alone. Keep the three languages
   consistent: a convenience that makes sense in one usually makes sense in all three.
   Never silence a failure by deleting a test, an example, or an export.

5. **Re-run steps 1-3 until Kotlin tests and the Python import both pass.** If you cannot
   get them green, still open the pull request, but say plainly at the top of the body
   what is failing and paste the error.

**Swift cannot be compiled here.** This runner is Linux; building the Swift package needs
the xcframework and a macOS toolchain. Regenerating `SiaStorageSDK.swift` and updating
`Wrappers.swift` is all you can verify — the repository's own `swift.yml` builds and
tests Swift on the pull request. Say so in the body rather than implying Swift passed.

6. **Check the changed files.** Run `git status` and revert any change outside
   `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `Package.swift`, `SiaStorageSDK.podspec`, `python/`,
   `swift/`, `kotlin/`, `examples/`, `src/`, `README.md`, and `.gitignore`. Any other
   file rejects the whole pull request. List what you reverted in the body, along with
   any `.github/` workflow change the update needs.

## Output

Emit one `create_pull_request` targeting `SiaFoundation/sia-storage-sdk`. Title it
`update sia_storage_ffi to X.Y.Z` (the `chore: ` prefix is added for you). The body should
cover, in prose:

- the version and rev move, and the upstream changes that motivated it
- what changed in the regenerated bindings, and every wrapper or example you edited
- which checks you actually ran and their result, and that Swift was not compiled
- anything left undone: a binding you could not wrap, or a failing check

Call `noop` with a short explanation instead of opening a pull request when `repinned` is
false, or when the regenerated bindings and all three wrappers come out byte-identical
and every check passes — that is the expected outcome for a release that only changes
crate internals.
