//! A Rust SDK for storing and retrieving data on the Sia decentralized storage network.
//!
//! [Sia](https://sia.tech) is a decentralized cloud storage platform where data is
//! stored across a global network of independent hosts. Storage contracts are
//! enforced by the Sia blockchain, so no single party controls your data. Compared
//! to centralized providers, Sia offers lower costs, stronger privacy (data is
//! client-side encrypted by default), and censorship resistance.
//!
//! This crate provides a high-level interface for interacting with Sia through an
//! indexer service. Data is automatically erasure-coded, encrypted, and distributed
//! across hosts on the network.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Define your [AppMetadata] as a constant. The [AppID] is used to derive the
//! user's encryption keys -- if it changes, previously stored data becomes
//! inaccessible. Generate it once (e.g. with a random hash) and never change it.
//!
//! Use [Builder] to connect to an indexer and obtain an [Sdk] instance. There are
//! two paths:
//!
//! - **First time**: Call [Builder::request_connection] to start the approval flow,
//!   then [Builder::wait_for_approval] once the user has approved, and finally
//!   [Builder::register] to complete setup. This derives an [AppKey] from the
//!   user's recovery phrase.
//! - **Returning**: Call [Builder::connected] with a previously exported [AppKey].
//!
//! Once you have an [Sdk], use it to upload, download, and manage objects:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Upload
//! let object = sdk.upload(Object::default(), reader, UploadOptions::default()).await?;
//! sdk.pin_object(&object).await?;
//!
//! // Download
//! let mut reader = sdk.download(&object, DownloadOptions::default())?;
//! tokio::io::copy(&mut reader, &mut writer).await?;
//! ```
//!
//! # Key management
//!
//! The [AppKey] grants full access to a user's data. After connecting, retrieve it
//! with [Sdk::app_key], then persist it using [AppKey::export] and restore it with
//! [AppKey::import] so users don't need to re-approve on every launch.
